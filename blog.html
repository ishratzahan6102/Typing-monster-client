            <h1>Question/Answers</h1>
            <div class="article">
                <h4>Question 1 : What is the different between session storage and local storage?</h4>
                <p>Answer : sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article">
                <h4>Question 2 : What is the different between global scope and block scope ?</h4>
                <p>Answer : A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks. Var can declare a variable either in the global or local scope. The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.

                <h4>Question 3 : How does event loop work in JS?</h4>
                <p>Answer : The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                <h4>Question 4 : How many ways are there to get undefined?</h4>
                <p>Answer : When you declare a variable and don’t initialize it to a value, the variable will have a      value of undefined. <br>
                  If you access a non-existing property of an object, you’ll get undefined. <br>
                  When you call a function with a number of parameters, you often pass the same number of arguments. <br>
                  A function that doesn’t have a return statement implicitly returns undefined. <br>
                  When you access an array element that is out-of-bounds, you’ll get the undefined value. <br></p>
